# About

I like movies but hate making decisions. Even if I were up to make a decision, half the time, I find a movie and then realize I'd have to buy it because it's not streaming on one of the 15 services I already pay for. I want to click a button and know what I get fits my mood and is available to me on a streaming service I have.

Enter Movie Surf!

Yeah, it's called *Movie Surf*. Which seemed like a great name to me—an old who grew up surfing channels and the web. I realized after buying the domain that no one actually surfs anything but water these days.

At any rate, I hope this is useful to some of you.

Enjoy,
Steve
