# Uh Oh — Open AI Spending Limit Reached

I've set a monthly spending limit with OpenAI of $20—you are seeing this message because I've hit said limit. I don't charge for this site because I just want everyone to be able to find a damn movie to watch without any fuss of account creation and what not (and I'm bad at business).

Here's my pitch: If you [support the site](https://buymeacoffee.com/sledsworth), I will increase the spending limit. Not only will you be able to find a movie to watch tonight (no need to endlessly scroll Netflix), you'll be supporting the community! Feels pretty good, huh?

To make things more exciting, if you set up a monthly subscription, I will call out your support right here on movie.surf for all to see (include a link to your social media account of choice if you'd like that included)—if that's something you are into.

Thanks for supporting me,<span style="display: block; font-weight: bold;">Steve</span>
